# 📘 21 Days of Problem Solving

## 🚀 A 21-day challenge to strengthen problem-solving skills using JavaScript

This repository documents my daily journey of solving coding problems consistently for 21 days.  
The primary focus is on **logic building**, **data structures**, **algorithms**, and writing **clean, optimized JavaScript solutions**.

The goal of this challenge is to build strong fundamentals and develop an interview-ready problem-solving mindset.

## 📅 Daily Progress

Each day represents focused practice on specific concepts, with problems solved using optimal and readable approaches.

### ✅ Day-wise Breakdown

**DAY-1**  
Solved beginner-level problems using loops, conditionals, and basic logical thinking.

**DAY-2**  
Practiced fundamental problems involving conditions, comparisons, and mathematical logic.

**DAY-3**  
Worked on nested loops, pattern printing, and multiple homework problems to strengthen core logic.

**DAY-4**  
Completed all assigned homework problems and progressed toward more structured problem-solving.

**DAY-5**  
Solved all lecture questions, improved solution accuracy, and developed better coding discipline.

**DAY-6**  
Focused on number-based problems including prime numbers and Fibonacci series. Solved all homework and class problems with increased confidence.

**DAY-7**  
Practiced prime factorization and composite number problems. Strengthened number theory concepts and completed all class questions.

**DAY-8**  
Solved all homework and assignment problems. Noticed significant improvement in logical thinking and confidence.

**DAY-9**  
Implemented core string algorithms such as substring search, substring index search, rotation checks, and optimized string logic problems.

**DAY-10**  
Implemented core array problems using **optimal approaches**, including:
- Manual logic-based solutions  
- JavaScript inbuilt methods where appropriate  
- Focus on time and space complexity  

Revisited earlier problems and re-solved them using more optimized approaches.
